Notes are for reading later and quickly remembering what you read/learned. Blog posts are for explaining a topic clearly and completely.

Below is a short list of the differences between blog posts and notes on this website.

| Blog                                                         | Note                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| For you 80%, for me 20%.                                     | For you 40%, for me 60%.                              |
| A complete work on a specific topic (may include a few updates later). | A "work-in-progress" work that is updated frequently. |
| More words / explanations.                                   | Focus on the codes, no superfluous words/phrases.     |
| Know / read the topic beforehand (not required).             | Know / read the topic beforehand (required).          |
| Contains fewer errors.                                       | Contains more errors.                                 |

Sometimes, there are some posts that are written as both a blog and a note.
